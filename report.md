Following the miniproject github, we were able to set up our raspberry pi and run the bluetooth and wifi scripts successfully. 
Overall, we simply followed the steps in the miniproject github. There was a little struggle with running wifi_scan.py but after downloading some modules such as Pandas we were able to run it. After running wifi_scan.py for 15 minutes by setting the number of loops argument to a very large number, 15 minutes worth of wifi data was saved as a JSON file. Furthermore, we were able to log the bluetooth scan onto a text file after editing ble_scan.py. After obtaining data with the raspberry pi, we ran the wifi_plot.py script to plot the number of wifi devices over time.
