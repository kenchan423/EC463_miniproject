Following the miniproject github, we were able to set up our raspberry pi and run the bluetooth and wifi scripts successfully. 
Overall, we simply followed the steps in the miniproject github. There was a little struggle with running wifi_scan.py but after downloading some modules such as Pandas we were able to run it. After running wifi_scan.py with a large argument for number of loops, we were able to save 15 minutes worth of data about wifi data onto a JSON file. Furthermore, we were able to log the bluetooth scan onto a text file after editing ble_scan.py.

After obtaining data with the raspberry pi, we decided to extract some simple features such as the number of wifi over time.
